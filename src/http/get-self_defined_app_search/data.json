    "content": "from Greek for hate or hatred Use -Misia can be appended to minoritised identifiers that are targeted for hate  such as fat (fatmisia)  trans (transmisia)  or Islam (Islamomisia). Issues -Phobia is Greek for &#39;fear of&#39;. When used as a suffix in the context of Islamophobia  transphobia  or fatphobia  it is implied that the individual or group has a fear of individuals and communities who identify in those ways. Rather than a direct translation  however  the implication and subtext of these terms is one of prejudice and discrimination. Using the term phobia falsely masks hate as fear. Additionally  people with anxiety disorders and mental illness can also experience phobias  so conflating prejudice and discrimination (attitudes and behaviours that can be changed) with medical conditions that cannot be changed additionally harms people who experience phobias from their anxiety disorders. As such  using the term phobia removes the responsibility from those who exhibit prejudice and discrimination as it implies it is outside of their control. Impact Hateful actions of prejudice and discrimination are unfairly conflated with mental illness. It can create a false parallel where one could imply that actual phobias are something that can be controlled  which harms people who experience actual phobias. Meanwhile  people exhibiting prejudice and discrimination are given excuses for their bigoted behaviour and not held accountable for their actions. Preferable To -phobia "

In 2017  the hand gesture was appropriated by White Supremacists on 4chan to mean White Power (the three fingers forming at &#39;W&#39; and thumb and index forming the circle of the &#39;P&#39;). It was framed as a hoax to &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; Leftists through trickery and gaslighting. The hand gesture has been used by White Supremacists as a dogwhistle to identify other White Supremacists at rallies  in forums  and even at court hearings. In 2019  the hand gesture was added to the Anti-Defamation League&#39;s list of official symbols of hate. Issues While it can be argued that the symbol&#39;s origins and many of its uses do not imply racist connotations  and that the 4chan-ers &amp;quot;framed it as a hoax &amp;quot; it is undeniable that the symbol has evolved and become a gesture used sincerely by white supremacists. The uncertainty created by the 4chan-ers is a critical part of their strategy. The strategy employs plausible deniability: Because they self-identified it as a hoax  they can fall back on that explanation. Meanwhile  if people begin to adapt the symbol  as they did  it becomes a dogwhistle for White Supremacists. It should be noted that this approach of indoctrinating symbols of hate is one long-documented  and used for the Swastika as well. Impact The people most vulnerable to the oppressive impact of White Supremacy will never know for certain if the symbol is being used in one of its non-violent manners or if it&#39;s being used in its racist violent manners. The oppressed must choose the option that protects them  which is typically erring on the side of caution. Continuing to use the symbol with its non-hateful connotations to &amp;quot;take it back &amp;quot; does not eliminate its pervasive new meaning associated with White Supremacy. Instead  continuing usage only perpetuates emotional and psychological harm upon the most vulnerable and susceptible populations. Other Languages Fran√ßais "

Related Words derp  derp face  herp derp  hurr durr Issues Derpy is very commonly used as an adjective to describe someone&#39;s clumsy or foolish behavior  occasionally that of the speaker themselves. Sometimes it is used as a direct replacement of the r-word. It is also used to describe someone else&#39;s physical features as unattractive or akin to someone with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In imagery  derpy or a so-called &amp;quot;derp face&amp;quot;  is often signified by crossed eyes  a stuck out tongue  or permanent facial differences. Origins The word &amp;quot;derp&amp;quot; found its first known use in the 1998 film Baseketball by the creators of the American animated sitcom  South Park  and later in South Park itself in the name of the character &amp;quot;Mr Derp&amp;quot;. The creators of the show have expressed that the term is uttered when one &amp;quot;screws up&amp;quot;. In these early uses the word is interchangeable with the words &amp;quot;duh&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;hur&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dur&amp;quot; that came before it  and may have directly or indirectly originated from them. The word evolved in 4chan and other forums and began being associated with memes  where the &amp;quot;derpy&amp;quot; imagery began. It is there where it became associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/IDD) specifically  as people started overlaying &amp;quot;derp&amp;quot; over photographs of children with I/DD. Impact Regardless of whether derpy is being used to describe yourself  or someone with or without an I/DD or physical disability  use of the word contributes to the dehumanisation  stigmatisation  and negative perceptions of people with an I/DD or physical (especially facial) differences. By using ableist language  we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental  developmental  or physical disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm  regardless of our intent. Usage Tip Be more specific. Typically we can find an alternate definition by taking time to reflect on what emotion we&#39;re really feeling. If you are describing a person&#39;s silly actions or expressions use a more relevant  descriptive word. If you are using it to describe or refer to a person&#39;s disability or physical difference  don&#39;t. "

It was subsequently appropriated by white men in the 1980s  particularly on the West Coast  and has since grown to be used broadly by white men and women as a noun as well as a discourse marker. When used as a discourse marker  it carries the connotation that the speaker believes that they are speaking to a man; however  as both a discourse marker and a noun  it is frequently used without regard for the gender or pronouns of listeners. Impact Regardless of the intent of the speaker  prefacing a statement with &amp;quot;dude&amp;quot; risks misgendering its audience and perpetuating a culture that favors traditional masculinity as the baseline for gender. Proponents of using &amp;quot;dude&amp;quot; commonly defend its usage aggressively by claiming that they use it in a gender-neutral way (which is not possible) and that anyone negatively impacted by its usage is wrong for not accepting that and chooses to apply the gendered interpretation. The argument fails to acknowledge that society dictates and reinforces gender  regardless of the individual interpretation. The ubiquity of that argument often deters those who are negatively impacted from bringing attention to the usage of &amp;quot;dude&amp;quot; as their experiences are often gaslighted. Alt Words Mindfulness Note Before using colloquial terms of endearment  it&#39;s important to be mindful of power and context. While our intent may be to make people feel at east or comfortable  we can have the opposite effect. For example  &amp;quot;buddy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pal&amp;quot; from an older person to younger person or a manager to employee can feel infantilising or pejorative; this becomes exacerbated because of the power differential in the relationship. The person in less power often isn&#39;t in a position to correct. There&#39;s no one-size fits all modal; instead we should seek to address people with consent first and course correct. It&#39;s not about getting it perfect at first  it&#39;s about getting it right in the end. "

    "content": "Issues The word Oriental is rooted in the concept of Orientalism  which is strongly articulated by Edward Said in eponymous book  Orientalism. In his book  Said illustrates the Orient as being the observed &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;foreigner &amp;quot; whereas the Occident (or the West) is centred as the default. All Eastern culture is prescribed through this imperialist  pejorative lens  where it is deemed as strange  exotic  dirty  effeminate  and weak. By presenting Eastern culture through this lens  Western culture may present set itself up for dominance through cultural hegemony and colonisation. Calling someone Oriental reinforces those hegemonic ideas even if you&#39;re unaware of its historical context. Impact By continuing use of this term  we are perpetuating anti-Asian sentiments and the centralisation of Western (i.e.  Occidental) imperialism. Diverse Asian people  nations  and cultures are flattened into one caricature of itself  which is dehumanising. "

Usage If you&#39;re in a group setting  it&#39;s best to lead by example by sharing your own pronouns if you feel comfortable. &amp;quot;I&#39;m Jack  my pronouns are they/them.&amp;quot; When referring to someone&#39;s pronouns  it&#39;s best to follow their lead. People will say &amp;quot;My pronoun(s) is/are...&amp;quot; When you are not sure  ask what pronouns you should use and for what context  in particular if you will be writing or speaking about them in a public setting. If you can  it&#39;s best to ask them one-on-one in a private setting. If you can&#39;t  likely they&#39;ll tell you the pronouns that make sense for that public setting. Sometimes people will list their pronouns on their websites  email signatures  social media bios  etc. While you can refer to those places for usage  it generally doesn&#39;t hurt to confirm how you should refer to the person in the particular context  as some people use different pronouns in different settings. (For example  someone might not feel comfortable using a set of pronouns that might &amp;quot;out them&amp;quot; (reveal aspects of their gender identity) in a place they don&#39;t feel safe doing so. When you are not sure and unable to confirm (such as if the person is deceased)  it&#39;s generally best to use they/them pronouns. However  note that some people do not like the use of they/them pronouns  which is sometimes the case for someone who has to work very hard to match their perceived gender identity to their pronouns. If it seems complicated  it is because it is. Pronouns can be really important to people as they can represent a lot to a person about their identity. It&#39;s best to try your hardest then course-correct as needed. Tips for Asking Keeping your question simple usually is best: &amp;quot;What pronoun(s) should I use for you [add context if it&#39;s beyond one on one usage  including who might see it]?&amp;quot; Avoid adding extra words  like  &amp;quot;preferred pronoun&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gender pronoun&amp;quot; Tips for Correction If you get someone&#39;s pronouns wrong and you&#39;re alerted of it or realise  correct the pronoun  apologise swiftly  and move on. Avoid dwelling on it (providing long back story or berating yourself and expecting them to console you). It can be very uncomfortable for whom you used the wrong pronoun  as it can often mean misgendering them. When you dwell on your mistake  you&#39;re asking someone who just had an uncomfortable  potentially oppressive experience  to then console you. Gross. If you notice someone use the wrong pronouns for someone  correct the pronoun. &amp;quot;Jack uses they/them pronouns.&amp;quot; Be certain that you are sure that the person would want you to use these pronouns in this setting  as you can accidentally &amp;quot;out&amp;quot; somebody if you&#39;re not careful. Considerations  Usually people will list the pronouns as they/them or they/them/theirs. Some people use multiple pronouns  such as she/they or they/he. Sometimes the order of these can imply which pronoun they use more frequently or if there is a slight preference to one over the other. It can also sometimes imply that they are in transition between using one pronoun to another. It can also imply none of these things  so it is best not to assume. Some people change their pronouns based on settings. For example  if someone is transitioning and does not want to be outed in one setting  they may use different pronouns in that setting. Hence  why it is important to follow someone&#39;s lead and to confirm usage based on context. They/them is a singular pronoun and has been since the late 1300s  so if someone tries to tell you that it&#39;s only plural  it&#39;s unlikely they take issue with the grammar but with something else. Some plural people will refer to themselves as &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; to represent their plural identities.  Places to Put Pronouns Generally speaking  whereever your name appears  including your pronouns is a good place to do so. The website pronoun.is is helpful as it appends someone&#39;s pronouns to a link  and gives explanation to pronoun usage. You may see people include this in their various bios. Some ideas of places to put pronouns include:  Conference talks/webinars Email signatures Introductions (If you&#39;re introducing two or more people  make sure you confirm their pronouns if you&#39;re not certain) Nametags Social media bios Video conference name fields Websites  Impact By respecting others&#39; pronouns  asking them for consent  and sharing our own pronouns  we can normalise this step in socialisation. Doing so causes us to pause before presuming someone&#39;s pronouns. When people presume pronouns  it can lead to misgendering  which causes harm toward people  particularly trans and non-binary folks. It is particularly important for people whose gender presentation and identity aligns with their pronouns to take this step  as they have the most power to influence society.

In modern use  the r-word is generally used as a denigrating term for a person with an I/DD  or to compare someone without an I/DD to someone with an I/DD in a derogatory sense. Issues While the term was previously used in a medical context  use of the word has transitioned to having a negative connotation in modern language. Changes are being made in both the medical and legal fields to reflect that conversational shift. Rosa&#39;s Law was passed in 2010 to eliminate all references to &amp;quot;mental retardation&amp;quot; in U.S. federal law  replacing them with &amp;quot;intellectual disability&amp;quot;. The DSM-5 update in 2013 replaced &amp;quot;mental retardation&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;intellectual disability&amp;quot;. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the handbook used by health care professionals in the United States and much of the world as the authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. The DSM is periodically revised to align the manual&#39;s content with modern language and in reflection of the most up-to-date research and diagnostic criteria.

Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm  regardless of our intent. Alt Words If you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is relevant  first be certain that they have an I/DD. Use a term that does not have a derogatory connotation (&amp;quot;intellectual disability&amp;quot;  or the name of the actual disability  if applicable). If you use the name of the actual disability  be certain that you are correct  and be certain that they are comfortable with using the name. If you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is not relevant  don&#39;t. Describe something else about them as a person. if someone is writing an article about a person with an I/DD  the relevance of their I/DD should be led by them. Avoid &amp;quot;inspiration porn&amp;quot;  which is the portrayal of people with disabilities as inspirational solely or in part on the basis of their disability. (Coined by Stella Young). If you are using it to describe or refer to a person without an I/DD  don&#39;t. Use a different  more relevant  descriptive word. "

    "content": "(adj) not domesticated  primative or civilised; wild  uncultivated; cold-blooded; colloquially used to mean ruthless or unconscionable. (noun) an undomesticated person  subhuman. Issues &amp;quot;Following the discovery of America  the phrase &amp;quot;savage&amp;quot; for indigenous peoples was used disparagingly to justify colonialism. The concept of the savage gave Europeans the supposed right to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting  functional societies.&amp;quot;1. The term savage is deeply rooted in settler colonialism  used primarily to justify colonisation by dehumanising Indigenous people  in particular  with regard to North American Indigenous peoples. The theories behind the &amp;quot;noble savage&amp;quot; led to scientific racism. Boarding schools were constructed to separate Indigenous children from their parents  becuase white colonisers didn&#39;t believe that they were equipped to be parents. ‚ÄúWhen the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents  who are savages; he is surrounded by savages  and though he may learn to read and write his habits  and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write ‚Ä¶ [T]he Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence  and the only way to do that would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.‚Äù2 Impact By continuing to use this word  rooted in colonist history and context  while Indigenous people&#39;s lands are still being occupied and unceded  while more and more Indigenous women and girls continue to go missing  we are perpetuating a word that has been used to justify the past and the ongoing harm we commit against Indigenous peoples. Seemingly small actions like this contribute to the normalisation of the harm. Denying the etymology or power of the word as irrelevant is denying the history of its strength: Savage has been used to dehumanise Indigenous people in order to justify oppressing them or granting them fewer rights. The justifications have even included Supreme Court cases. The imagery associated with the &amp;quot;savage&amp;quot; is used to justify oppressive and systematic racism against Indigenous peoples; that they somehow deserve injustice because it is their own fault. Considerations Rihanna has a lingerie line called Savage by Fenty. Megan Thee Stallion has a song called &amp;quot;Savage.&amp;quot; The intersection of oppression of Black and Indigenous cultures is one worth noting. Gwen Benaway&#39;s piece  Rihanna‚Äôs Lingerie Line Brings Up a Complicated Discussion About Language addresses this complexity: &amp;quot;As much as we like clear right and wrongs with easy retweetable hot takes  some issues‚Äîlike the dialogue about savage between Indigenous and Black communities‚Äîisn‚Äôt one to simplify.&amp;quot; "

Common Issues Commonly referred to in conversation and journalism as &amp;quot;committed suicide&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;took their own life&amp;quot;  or similar  which can have negative connotations with criminality and judgement  and can place blame on the individual. Can also be used in combination with a related measure of &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; which promotes suicide as a desirable result. Suicide is sometimes used colloquially to mean something will severely negatively impact you (e.g.  &amp;quot;social suicide&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;career suicide&amp;quot;). Replace &amp;quot;career suicide&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;career-ending &amp;quot; which conveys the same intent. Replace &amp;quot;social suicide&amp;quot; with a  complete rephrase where you avoid placing blame on the individual: &amp;quot;Doing this will negatively impact your social life.&amp;quot; Impact Unless used with sensitivity and care  discussion of suicide can reinforce negative stereotypes and stigma around mental illness. Sensationalist reporting of suicide also risks inadvertently promoting suicide. Usage Tips When discussing suicide and suicidal ideation:  Avoid mentioning details of methods used and suggesting that these are &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;painless&amp;quot; to reduce the risk of imitation. Avoid suggesting that suicide is an &amp;quot;easy way out&amp;quot;. Avoid speculation over possible triggers: Suicide and suicidal ideation is complex and not necessarily the result of a single event or condition. Attempting to explain away suicide with a specific cause or condition downplays the wider circumstances and the impact on all those affected. Instead of saying that a person &amp;quot;committed suicide&amp;quot;  say that a person &amp;quot;died by suicide.&amp;quot; Framing suicide as a symptom of wider/unknown-to-us conditions validates the individual as a victim  rather than a perpetrator. Discussing or reporting on suicide can be an opportunity to signpost the support available and educate people about the importance of mental wellbeing. Include local resources for people to gain help  such as links to suicide hotlines  mental health resources  etc. Ensure these resources are appropriately linked for ease of use (e.g.  ensure telephones are linked with tel tags  for example). Follow Reporting on Suicide&#39;s guidelines (or similar linked resources below)  especially if your reporting will be largely publicised. "

    "content": "group whose representation is disproportionately less than their proportion in the general population; often racial or ethnic minority is implied  but can be used to represent any identifier  such as LGBTQIA   disabled  gender  etc. abbreviated often to URM Issues Often people use URM to mean &amp;quot;minoritised racial group&amp;quot;  when it doesn&#39;t explicitly mean racial group in all contexts (even if that&#39;s the most commonly used context). It can cause confusion when which minoritised group is being spoken of  and can also lessen/erase additional intersections of identity. For example  if someone is disabled and of a minoritised racial group  using URM to imply racial group can erase their disability. Using a term like URM can also erase meaningful specificity. For example  an issue might specifically be relevant to Black folks  but by referring to the group as URM  it erases their Blackness  conflates/waters down issues  and reinforces the power dynamic of white and everyone else. URM can also imply that the group in question isn&#39;t &amp;quot;showing up&amp;quot; to be represented; that the burden is on the URM group to show up or to do more to improve their numbers and representation. Meanwhile  the complement  the overrepresented majority  tends to be unnamed. Impact By naming the underrepresented minority often without the overrepresented majority  we are often reinforcing the idea that people harmed by oppressive systems are on the hook to fix them. By repeatedly referring to groups as &amp;quot;minorities &amp;quot; they are being infantilised to their numerical representation and made to feel minor. The vagueness also abstracts the identify of the marginalised group  making it difficult to address why they are minoritised to begin with and often erasing the complexity of those intersections. Usage When using any term for a group  it&#39;s important to contextualise it into people. So  for example  &amp;quot;people from the underrepresented minorities are more likely to be affected by this change&amp;quot; over &amp;quot;the underrepresented minority are more likely to be affected by this change.&amp;quot; Additionally  it&#39;s important to examine the context of the usage:  Why are you placing focus on the URM groups? Will you also be speaking of the role overrepresented majorities play as well? Would examining and speaking of overrepresented majorities be more accurate to your context? Is URM accurate? If no  can you be more specific than URM?  Read also  minorities minoritised overrepresented majority "

White feminism is a tool of white supremacy  as it reinforces the power and default/idealised setting of whiteness. Examples  White feminists marching in the Women&#39;s March but absent for #BlackLivesMatter  and/or calling cops on Black/brown people for no reason other than existing. White feminists ensuring that there is women represented on a panel  but being fine if the panel is still all white  able-bodied  cisgender  etc. White feminists appropriating yoga  colonising its purpose from meditation to weight-loss  or improving vanity and outward appearance by white Westernised  able-bodied beauty standards. White feminists supporting &amp;quot;women&#39;s empowerment&amp;quot; for choice  while sex work-shaming. White feminists supporting &amp;quot;women&#39;s choices&amp;quot; while participating in fat-shaming or otherwise reinforcing conventional Western/Anglo beauty standards. White feminists employing microaggressions  weaponised compliments  or white women tears to invalidate the lived experiences of Black/brown women. White feminists aligning with their whiteness as a &amp;quot;pick me&amp;quot;  denying the intersectional issues that they do not face  but other multiply marginalised women do. White feminists calling attention to reproductive rights  while actively using trans-exclusive language (such as  associating menstrating with womanhood). White feminists exploit the duality of both being presented as someone can do no harm  while actively doing harm to multiply marginalised women.  Notes  Not all white women are necessary white feminists. However  as white feminism is a tool of white supremacy  it is one that every white woman (and white-/woman- presenting person) receives at birth by nature of their appearance as a form of white privilege. Furthermore  every white woman is empowered to use it to reinforce the power of the white supremecist capitalist patriarchy.  For a white woman to not be a white feminist  they must engage in actively dismantling their unearned privilege and fight their engrained nature. This usually involves learning how to become anti-racist  anti-ablelist  anti-transmisic  etc.  While it is not a white feminist&#39;s fault that they were born into  indoctrinated with  and socialised to use white feminist tools  it is their responsibility to examine and to unpack the harm they can intentional and unintentionally commit. Just like it&#39;s not minoritised women&#39;s fault that they were born into bodies that are harmed by white feminism.  White feminists can come in any gender  ability  race  orientation  nationality. White men benefit from supporting white feminism and white feminists  as it supports white supremacy. For Black/brown folks  the white feminism may take a form of internalised oppression and require a decolonialisation of self to understand.  Other forms of oppression do not negate this white privilege. So  a disabled white woman still is indoctrinated with the power of and benefits from white feminism and white privilege  at the harm of Black/brown disabled women. Same goes for size-privilege  etc.  Impact Black/brown women&#39;s issues become secondary and subordinate to the needs of white women. White feminism only advances white women  and often at the harm of Black and brown women and minoritised genders. In fact  often  once the needs of white women are met  Black/brown women are left behind. White feminism destroys the work against integrated and intersectional dismantling of the white supremecist capitalis patriarchy and kyriarchy. What To Do If you suspect you might be a white feminist  examine your brand of feminism.  What privileges do you possess that other women do not? How have you reinforced the systems of oppression (intentionally or unintentionally)? When reading feminist texts or thinking of feminist icons  who are you centring? Who is missing?  If you are white  examine your own white fragility. Reading Black feminist and womanist texts by authors like Angela Davis  bell hooks  and Audre Lorde is a good place to start. Editor&#39;s Notes Non-binary  agender  gender non-conforming  and other gender minoritised people are often neglected in traditional feminist rhetoric. In this entry  we&#39;ve explicitly not conflated and used the term &amp;quot;non-binary people and women&amp;quot; as many non-binary people do not like being lumped in with women. Exploring the nuance between even Black/brown women and Black/brown non-binary people  as one example  requires separate subtext beyond the scope of this singular definition. In our definition of women  we include trans women  because trans women are women. "
